# Special Thanks

 - Google for [Material Design][material] and the attention to color
 
 - [ChrisRM][chris-rm_link] for porting a [Material Theme][chris-rm_theme] over to all of JetBrain's IDEs. I have been wanting to create a Material color scheme for Android Studio for a while now, but always found starting this to be too cumbersome. With your inital color scheme, I was able to get started easily and finally got a look that I love. 

   From that point, I created ChroMATERIAL to push specific goals of mine.
